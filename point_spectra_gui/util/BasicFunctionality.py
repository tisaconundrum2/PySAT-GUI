    This class is a scaffolding class, it holds global
    functionality for all classes inheriting from it.
    It is here to simplify and globalize certain
    variables and functionalities to each of the
    UI classes.

    *Note: Rigorous prototyping is still occurring
    So, naturally, assume that something in this class
    is always getting changed or added to better serve
    all cases in each UI class.

    ...

    Since `Basics` is shared among all the UI
    classes it would make sense that we would have
    some variables, that are necessary among all these
    classes, be put here in a high place where they
    can be referenced often.
